# mutibpm3.5intft


This project is for a future User interface project or just to display multiple images if needed for a project.
icons file holds images for a test to insure this is working for your screen.

The images used in this file are converted images using GIMP v2.10 to bpm ( I use default setting when exporting the image to bmp the seeking program should render about any bmp Gimp puts out).
